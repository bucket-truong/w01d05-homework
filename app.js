//How do we assign a value to a variable?
  // the variable would come first, then the = "value" would follow

// How do we change the value of a variable?
  // you can change the value by writing the variable first, then = "new value" would follow

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
  // take the following value and set a new value for it

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
  //declare is to create a variable, assign and define is to set a value for the variable.

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
  //you should comment out a description of the opperation so that writing code will be more efficient. (an instruction for the code written in plain english)

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
  //you should spend majority of the time pseudocoding, because it'll cut the amount of time figuring out what goees where and limit the amount of mistakes.

  // 1. Create a variable called `firstVariable`.
  //   - Assign it the value of the string `"Hello World"`
  //   - Change the value of this variable to some number.
  //   - Store the value of `firstVariable` in a new variable called `secondVariable`
  //   - Change the value of `secondVariable` to any string.
  //   - What is the value of `firstVariable`?
  let firstVariable;
  firstVariable = "hello world"
  firstVariable = "zero"
  zero = "secondVariable"
  secondVariable = "bye"
  console.log(secondVariable);
  let yourName = "Davis Truong"
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${yourName}`);
